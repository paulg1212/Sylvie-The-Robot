## Animatronic Eye Mechanism

All pieces must be printed at 100.21% scale, as god intended.

When printing the main eyelid mechanisms, make sure you use 40mm/s speed, Brim heatbed adhesion and supports Touching Build Plate Only, as they are thin by design! Annealing them with oven heat would be a good idea for extra strength, too.

This will fit 4x Hextronik HX5010 servos, and 4x TowerPro SG90 micro-servos. (You can replace them with other brands so long as they are the same size.)

Files labeled as official are up to scale.
