## Blender files v0.20.1

Features a more realistic and natural looking head. The base model was created using a photogrammetric 3d scan of a human head with Meshroom and a DSLR camera. The rest of the details were sculpted by hand in Blender.

The files labeled as 'Disassembled' are the raw models with all the modifiers prior to application. 

Files labeled 'Official" are ready to be saved as .stl for 3d printing (make sure you use the model on the 2nd layer, as it is hollowed out for you.)

Your model should have a width of 170mm on X axis (corrected). Suitable for build plates of minimum 22cm square. If you only have a small build plate, you're gonna have to do some slicing, gluing, etc. But that's pretty much expected for most of the project anyway.

Note: Still under construction. More files coming shortly...
