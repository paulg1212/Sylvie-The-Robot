- [Animatronic Eye Mechanism](https://github.com/misses-robot/Sylvie-The-Robot/tree/master/blender/stable/animatronic-eyes)

Note on versioning: Version number represents changes in individual models or a couple of models. A revision represents changes across most models.

Features a more realistic and natural looking head. The base model was created using a photogrammetric 3d scan of a human head with Meshroom and a DSLR camera. The rest of the details were sculpted by hand in Blender.

The core of the model is the 3d printed part that is inserted into the mold after silicone is poured into it.

The files labeled as 'Disassembled' are the raw models with all the modifiers prior to application. 

Files labeled 'Official" are ready to be saved as .stl for 3d printing (make sure you use the model on the 2nd layer, as it is hollowed out for you.)

Your model should have a width of 170mm (100.21%) on X axis (corrected). Suitable for build plates of minimum 22cm square. If you only have a small build plate, you're gonna have to do some slicing, gluing, sanding, etc. But that's pretty much expected for most of the project anyway. Do NOT use epoxy as epoxy might cause cure inhibition with some platinum silicones. Only use ABS slurry for joining.

Your core should be around 167mm (100.21% as well) on X axis.

### Some notes on silicone casting

Smooth-On EcoFlex 00-10 (1.8kg / 4lb) should be used to cast the silicone head, and Smooth-On Mold Star 20T should be used to create your brush on mold. (2.7kg / 6lb).

If you can't get hold of Mold Star 20T, then go with PlatSilÂ® 73-15. In fact I think that would be far better as it's slightly softer and will make demolding easier.

Definitely don't use any Mold Star 15, 16 or 30 though, because they can't be thickened. Also don't use Platsil Gel 25 as it's probably too hard for this particular cast (the mold has to be flipped inside out like a sock when demolding).

Check out Brick in the Yard Mold Supply on YouTube for great silicone casting/molding tutorials. The videos on my YouTube channel are also pretty informative, but they're merely an overview, not tutorials. 

Unfortunately, in order to make more detailed video tutorials, I would have to create another copy of Sylvie's head... which will simply not be practical unless I somehow get appropriate funding for it.

That said, I will try to leave as much written information on here as possible. But just be aware that you are taking a risk and be ready to make mistakes along the way.

When you finish casting your silicone head, you will have to slice the eyes open and perform delicate 'mouth surgery' on the lips. Try to incorporate a delicate 'M' shape to the lip, as no human lip is perfectly straight. Use a reference image for assistance. Then paint over it with a thick layer of EcoFlex 00-10. Do this after you've finished your full-face paint job.

I might open the mouth a little bit more in future models so that you don't have to do any of this, but still... there will always be some slicing to do, like the eyes, etc. The key is to remove as little as possible, because you can always remove more chunks, but it's harder to correct mistakes if you've overdone it... though not impossible.

Make sure you have some SilPoxy in handy so you can fix accidental tears, etc.

### Cute or creepy?

You will start to feel a connection to your girl once you've completed your silicone paint job and completed the eye and mouth surgery. Maybe don't call her Sylvie unless you really want to, give her a name of your own. Be creative. Live your dream, not somebody elses!
