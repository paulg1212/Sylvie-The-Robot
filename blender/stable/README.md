## Blender files v0.21.0

- **Head Model (we are here!)**
- [Animatronic Skull Mechanism](https://github.com/misses-robot/Sylvie-The-Robot/tree/master/blender/stable/animatronic-skull)
- [Animatronic Eye Mechanism](https://github.com/misses-robot/Sylvie-The-Robot/tree/master/blender/stable/animatronic-eyes)

Features a more realistic and natural looking head. The base model was created using a photogrammetric 3d scan of a human head with Meshroom and a DSLR camera. The rest of the details were sculpted by hand in Blender.

The core of the model is the 3d printed part that is inserted into the mold after silicone is poured into it.

The files labeled as 'Disassembled' are the raw models with all the modifiers prior to application. 

Files labeled 'Official" are ready to be saved as .stl for 3d printing (make sure you use the model on the 2nd layer, as it is hollowed out for you.)

Your model should have a width of 170mm (100.21%) on X axis (corrected). Suitable for build plates of minimum 22cm square. If you only have a small build plate, you're gonna have to do some slicing, gluing, sanding, etc. But that's pretty much expected for most of the project anyway. Do NOT use epoxy as epoxy might cause cure inhibition with some platinum silicones. Only use ABS slurry for joining.

Your core should be around 167mm (100.21% as well) on X axis.

Note: Still under construction. More files coming shortly...
