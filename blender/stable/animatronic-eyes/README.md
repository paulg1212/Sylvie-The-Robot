## Animatronic Eye Mechanism

All pieces must be printed at 100.21% scale, as god intended.

Eyeballs must be printed at 25mm diameter. (You'll have to sand down the ball joints a little bit until it fits!)

Servo horns seem to fit the microservos at 80% scale. (Then again sometimes you'll have prints that don't fit at all, or are simply too lose. It's better to print multiple pieces just to be safe.)

Files named 'Pulleys' are basically 3d printed sticks that enable eyeball and eyelid movement. Again, you'll have to do lots of filing in order to carve them into the proper shape. It's especially tricky to carve the little holes open.

When printing the main eyelid mechanisms, make sure you use 40mm/s speed, Brim heatbed adhesion and supports Touching Build Plate Only, as they are thin by design! Annealing them with oven heat would be a good idea for extra strength, too. Alternatively just use nail hardener or XTC-3d.

This will fit 4x Hextronik HX5010 servos, and 4x TowerPro SG90 micro-servos. (You can replace them with other brands so long as they are the same size.)

All files are up to scale.
