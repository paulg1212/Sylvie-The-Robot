## Animatronic Skull

Animatronic skull as well as a temporary support platform for the head.

NOTE: Many changes have been made to some of these models, especially the thickness and structure of the skull (use the separate skull .blend file, not the ones in the 'official' file). 

Also keep in mind that these are really fragile parts, so be prepared to tweak 3d printer settings, or maybe reinforce with XTC-3d. Using custom supports is also a good idea because a lot of the computer-generated supports tend to snap mid-print when printing the skull.

Orientation of the main skull print is also very important with this print. Print it with the eyes facing the ceiling, as most of the forces acting on it are on the Z axis.
