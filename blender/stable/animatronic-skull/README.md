## Animatronic Skull

Animatronic skull as well as a temporary support platform for the head.

Keep in mind that the cheek bones and the jaw model are just solid motionless placeholders for now, so that I can test the animatronic eye mechanism on its own.

NOTE: Many changes have been made to some of these models, especially the thickness and structure of the skull (use the separate skull .blend file, not the ones in the 'official' file). 

Also keep in mind that these are really fragile parts, so be prepared to tweak 3d printer settings, or maybe reinforce with XTC-3d. Using custom supports is also a good idea because a lot of the computer-generated supports tend to snap mid-print when printing the skull.

Try using: 240c temp, 0.25mm layer height, 70% infill, 3 wall shell thickness.

Orientation of the main skull print (the part that holds the eye mechanism) is also very important. Print it with the eyes facing the ceiling, as most of the forces acting on it are on the Z axis.

This will, however, make it less resistant to bending. So do not bend it more than 1cm~ when inserting animatronic eye mechanism. It should slide in like a hard drive anyway, that's what it was designed to do.
