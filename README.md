Sylvie the Robot is an open source, 3d printable robot featuring a silicone face molded from 3d printed models. 
She is going to feature realistic animatronics capable of a wide range of expressions and emotions. 

Arduino will be a major component involved in controlling the face, head and limb mechanisms. 
NVIDIA Jetson TX2 will act as the 'brains' of the robot and provide her with advanced AI capabilities such as 
deep learning, computer vision, speech recognition, etc.

### Background

<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/misses-robot/Sylvie-The-Robot/blob/master/sylvie-demo.JPG" width="500" ></a>

Sylvie was initially intended to be a 'sex-robot', or a 'lover-robot'. To be honest, I kinda regret having classified her 
by this narrow definition.

Ideally, we'd want her to be a multi-purpose robot suitable for a variety of applications. This doesn't mean I'm
going to shy away from the fact that, quite frankly; we are creating her because we are lonely and in need of some company.

She is modeled after Mary Elizabeth Winstead.

### Wait, Silicone? Can you 3d print in silicone?

Eh, no. You don't have to. Just 3d print your head model, sand it down, and then make a brush on mold on top of it. Then cast silicone into your silicone mold with a release agent, insert your ABS core and you're done. Once you get the hang of it, it becomes fun, addicting.. and opens your mind and imagination to limitless possibilities!

### Why is this free?

It's free as in open source. You still have to buy the materials yourself.

Why is it open source? Because I believe I have the moral duty to fight for a fairer, more egalitarian society. We absolutely do not want robotics to be a field that is dominated by powerful corporations, and governments, for the matter. 

It should be the god-given right of every human being to have basic necessities. If there's anything we can learn from Amazon Alexa - it's the fact that she won't play Bob Seger's Ole Time Rock'n Roll unless you subscribe to Amazon Music. 

Don't let your future companion robots be another means for corporations to leech off of working class people!

### Aren't you just reinventing the wheel? Pretty sure Japan are already working on sex-bots.

While Sylvie the Robot will be capable of sexual intercourse, she isn't a sex-robot by definition.. any more than you and me are sex-humans.

What will set Sylvie apart from RealDolls and Harmonies, is the fact that she will cater to those who are genuinely lonely, not people with overactive sex drives.

She will be something along the lines of a Therapist / Life Coach / Personal Trainer / Social Worker / Sexual Surrogate.

In other words - she will be like a gamer's customized Linux gaming PC dream rig, in a world of overpriced MacBook Airs and Windows Tablets.

Sex-bot companies will also set their own rules as to what they allow, and what they don't allow their clients to request 
(e.g. A robot that looks like your ex, or a robot that looks like a celebrity). 

With project Sylvie, anything goes, as long as you aren't actually hurting anybody.

### How to contribute

You are welcome to submit your own 3d models and I will add them to my collection and give credit to the author if they are
deemed suitable.

Once we build a decent animatronic head we can start looking for programmers. You only really need to know Python and Arduino,
and some C/C++ I guess. We want to keep the nature of the project as simple and beginner-friendly as possible.

### Project status

Start date: 8th of October, 2018

Status: Casting silicone head. 

Progress: 5% Complete

|_____-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Finished sculpting new improved 3d model for the silicone head cast. Will then be working on designing a good core, a skull and the rest of the animatronic rigs for the head. I will write down all the electronic components and parts used, and also upload the Arduino code.

Fun fact: a real 3d scan of a real head was used for the base model.
