Sylvie the Robot is an open source, 3d printable robot featuring a silicone face molded from 3d printed models. 
She is going to feature realistic animatronics capable of a wide range of expressions and emotions. 

Arduino will be a major component involved in controlling the face, head and limb mechanisms. 
NVIDIA Jetson TX2 will act as the 'brains' of the robot and provide her with advanced AI capabilities such as 
deep learning, computer vision, speech recognition, etc.

### Background

Sylvie was initially intended to be a 'sex-robot', or a 'lover-robot'. To be honest, I kinda regret having classified her 
by this narrow definition.

Ideally, we'd want her to be a multi-purpose robot suitable for a variety of applications. This doesn't mean I'm
going to shy away from the fact that, quite frankly; we are creating her because we are lonely and in need of some company.

She is modeled after Mary Elizabeth Winstead.

### Wait, Silicone? Can you 3d print in silicone?

Eh, no. You don't have to. Just 3d print your head model, sand it down, and then make a brush on mold on top of it. Then cast silicone into your silicone mold with a release agent. Simple!

### How to contribute

You are welcome to submit your own 3d models and I will add them to my collection and give credit to the author if they are
deemed suitable.

Once we build a decent animatronic head we can start looking for programmers. You only really need to know Python and Arduino,
and some C/C++ I guess. We want to keep the nature of the project as simple and beginner-friendly as possible.

### Project status

Finished sculpting new improved 3d model for the silicone head cast. Will then be working on designing a good core, a skull and the rest of the animatronic rigs for the head. I will write down all the electronic components and parts used, and also upload the Arduino code.

Fun fact: a real 3d scan of a real head was used for the base model.
