## Sylvie-The-Robot v0.10

### Introduction

Sylvie the Robot is an open source, 3d printable robot featuring a silicone face molded from 3d printed models. 
She is going to feature realistic animatronics capable of a wide range of expressions and emotions. 

Arduino will be a major component involved in controlling the face, head and limb mechanisms. 
NVIDIA Jetson TX2 will act as the 'brains' of the robot and provide her with advanced AI capabilities such as 
deep learning, computer vision, speech recognition, etc.

### Background

Sylvie was initially intended to be a 'sex-robot', or a 'lover-robot'. To be honest, I kinda regret having classified her 
by this narrow definition.

Ideally, we'd want her to be a multi-purpose robot suitable for a variety of applications. This doesn't mean I'm
going to shy away from the fact that, quite frankly; we are creating her because we are lonely and in need of some company.
