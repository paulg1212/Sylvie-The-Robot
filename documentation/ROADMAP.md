## Roadmap for Project Sylvie

### Mission statement. 
We will create a multipurpose, 3d printable, female humanoid robot featuring realistic animatronic silicone skin by New Year's Eve 2020. It must be capable of emulating human behaviors such as communication, basic reasoning skills, displaying emotions, carrying objects, walking, playing video games, playing board games, playing sports, intimacy and sexual intercourse. It must pass the Turing test and overcome the Uncanny Valley.

### Stage 1: Casting a silicone head.

Sylvie the Robot is an android (technically, gynoid) that features animatronic silicone skin. Since we're modelling her to look as 
human and aesthetically pleasing as possible, we're going to have to adapt the hardware to the chassis, rather than adapting
the chassis to the hardware, as is usually done in the quirky, clunky world of robotics.

For this reason, we will be starting out the project by designing, 3d printing, molding and casting her silicone face, 
before we even think about designing our animatronic rigs and setting up our hardware.

### Stage 2: Building our animatronic skull.

Once we've cast and painted our silicone face, and punched some eyebrows and eyelashes into it, we're ready to start designing, 3d printing, assembling, wiring and programming our animatronic skull.

### Stage 3: Building our torso.

We want our torso to be as modular as possible, as opposed to everything just being one piece. Every single cubic decimeter should be individually printable and modifiable/removable. This will make it a lot easier to correct mistakes along the way, and 
will save us a ton of money on materials.

### Stage 4: Building our arms.

### Stage 5: Building our legs.

### Stage 6: Setting up the brains.

We will be using an NVIDIA Jetson module, either Jetson Tx2 or Jetson Xavier, which will engage in serial communication with
arduino components all over the body. Adding a Raspberry Pi for backup and storage also wouldn't hurt.

(Until I'm able to afford this module, I will be using my GTX-1070 gaming rig as Sylvie's brain, with a remote control system.)

### Stage 7: Training our neural networks to speak.

### Stage 8: Training our neural networks to play games.

### Stage 9: Training our neural networks to walk.

### Stage 10: Training our neural networks for intimacy.
