## Roadmap for Project Sylvie

### Mission statement. 
We will create a multipurpose 3d printable, female humanoid robot featuring animatronic silicone skin, 
capable of emulating human behaviors such as communication, basic reasoning skills, displaying emotions, carrying objects, walking, playing video games, playing board games, playing sports, intimacy and sexual intercourse.

### Stage 1: Casing a silicone head.

Sylvie the Robot is an android that features animatronic silicone skin. Since we're modelling her to look as 
human and aesthetically pleasing as possible, we're going to have to adapt the hardware to the chassis, rather than adapting
the chassis to the hardware, as is usually done in the quirky, clunky world of robotics.

For this reason, we will be starting out the project by designing, 3d printing, molding and casting her silicone face, 
before we even think about designing our animatronic rigs and setting up our hardware.

### Stage 2: Building our animatronic skull.

Once we've cast and painted our silicone face, and punched some eyebrows and eyelashes into it, we're ready to start designing, 3d printing, assembling, wiring and programming our animatronic skull.
