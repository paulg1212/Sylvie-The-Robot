## Challenges and Practicality of Project Sylvie

### 1. The Uncanney Valley

In my opinion, the uncanney valley is solely caused by a miscommunication of body language.

e.g. Irises that are too small may give the illusion of eyes being open wider than they really are.
e.g. Incorrectly animated smiles may be misinterpreted as a menacing grin.
e.g. Faces that are smiling when they shouldn't be, can leave an impression of lack of empathy or untrustworthiness.
e.g. Movements that are jerky and do not ease-in / ease-out, may be interpreted as symptoms of disease.

It should also be noted that this phenomenon isn't just exclusive to robots. If you've ever looked at, say, people who've had
excessive amounts of plastic surgery, you'll notice that a lot of the times, their facial muscles are frozen up - which can
leave people feeling uneasy.

Even normal, healthy people may exhibit quirks that give off this uncanny valley effect e.g. having an odd-looking
grin that makes you uncomfortable.

How we can get around this problem:

1. Make sure you are satisfied how your animatronic head looks at resting/default position.
2. Make your animatronic head as versatile and modifiable as possible, so that animating movements becomes a matter of 
getting the right algorithm and writing the right code, as opposed to building a new head from scratch (which wastes time and resources).
3. Give your robot the capability to learn from real-life examples using motion capture.
4. Implement a reward system so that your robot learns to avoid making uncanny gestures, through trial and error (reinforcement
learning).

### 2. Artificial General Intelligence

For what is worth, even experts cannot come to an agreement as to what actually constitutes Artificial General Intelligence..
just as it is impossible to define what 'Common Sense' actually means.

In my opinion, even humans do not exhibit 'General Intelligence'. Some people make better mathematicians, others make better
musicians. Others make better plumbers. This is why we have to specialize.

The main problem we have with robots is that they're too predictable. That's because we need them to be predictable for most
intents and purposes.

One way to get around this is to introduce a degree of randomness into every task, and allow reinforcement learning
to do its magic.

All in all, many people seem to think that 'common sense' means 'universal sense'. There is no such thing as universal sense.

Thus, the only way to achieve 'Artificial General Intelligence' is to carry on experimenting with deep learning, break up 
bigger problems into smaller, more manageable tasks... until you end up with a 'Swiss Army Knife Intelligence', so to speak.

Focus on the problems that actually need solving, not emulating human behavior. We don't want to emulate human behavior, as a 
lot of what we do is stupid and pointless, anyway e.g. getting angry, getting jealous, being lazy, being greedy, being selfish, etc. none of which are traits that we even want in our robot.

Building a human-level intelligence misses the point, and defeats the purpose. 

If you're going to spend time and resources building something that acts, thinks and behaves exactly like a human being..
You may as well get a real human being to solve whatever problem it is you're trying to solve.
